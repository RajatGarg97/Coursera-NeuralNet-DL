##Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository holds all the programming assignments and other material from the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at Coursera.  
This is first course under Deep Learning Specialization.

I'll try my best to make the code as intuitive as possible by adding detailed comments in the notebooks. In case of any discrepancy or confusion feel free to suggest any edits.
